-Mori and Hayden-----------------------

What a lovelypleasure to be here! 

Mori, the god of death of this world, has been around for quite some time and looped in a mortal for fun. 
As you continue your godly duties of guiding lost souls to rest and reincarnation, now you have a friend by your side.
